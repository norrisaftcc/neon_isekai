## üî± GAME OVERVIEW

**Neon Spartan Isekai: A Cruel Angle's Thesis** is a tongue-in-cheek text-based RPG that blends ancient Spartan aesthetics with modern isekai anime tropes and 1980s neon visual style. Players control a protagonist who has been transported from the modern world into a bizarre hybrid reality where ancient Sparta meets synthwave aesthetics and anime logic.

The game serves as both an entertaining adventure and a scaffolding for learning AI fundamentals and programming concepts, with its four main gameplay areas mapping directly to educational objectives.

# NEON TAXIDERMY ISEKAI: STUFFED & DANGEROUS
## Game Concept Document v1.0

---

## ü¶ä GAME OVERVIEW

**Neon Taxidermy Isekai: Stuffed & Dangerous** is a text-based RPG where players are transported into the "Museum of Unnatural History" - a bizarre after-hours dimension where neon-infused taxidermy animals come alive. What seems like a horror scenario quickly becomes something more heartfelt, as you discover these creatures are former programmers, artists, and engineers trapped in animal forms, their memories and skills fragmented into code snippets hidden throughout the museum.

Players must build relationships with these misfit creatures, gather code fragments, and ultimately decide whether to help the animals return to human form, embrace their new existence, or escape alone.
