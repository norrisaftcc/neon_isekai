Here's how to create "Neon Taxidermy Isekai" as a CSS-soaked, emoji-filled Twine game:

1. **Twine Structure**: Organize passages into museum wings (🧵 Workshop, 📚 Archives, 🎛️ Control Room, 🌄 Dioramas) with animal character encounters as separate nodes.

2. **Neon CSS Effects**: 
   - Add glow effects with text-shadow properties 
   - Create color-coded sections for each wing
   - Implement a CRT screen effect with scanlines and flicker animation
   - Use gradient backgrounds that shift from dark to neon colors

3. **Emoji System**: Use consistent emojis for:
   - Stats (🛠️ CRAFT, 💖 HEART)
   - Skills (🎨 CREATE, 🗣️ EXPLAIN, 💻 CODE, 🔍 EXPLORE)
   - Animals (🦊 Fox, 🦉 Owl, 🐢 Turtle)
   - Resources (💾 Memory Fragments, ✨ Neon Essence)
   - Time cycles (🌆 Dusk, 🌙 Midnight, 🌅 Dawn)

4. **Simple Variable System**: Track stats, animal relationships, inventory, and time cycle using Twine's variable system.

5. **Time Cycle**: Create a day/night cycle that affects which animals are active and what actions are possible.

The implementation guide includes sample CSS, passage examples, and a skill check system to bring the stuffed animals to glowing neon life!
