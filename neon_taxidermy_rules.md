# NEON TAXIDERMY ISEKAI: STUFFED & DANGEROUS
## Game Concept Document v1.0

---

## ü¶ä GAME OVERVIEW

**Neon Taxidermy Isekai: Stuffed & Dangerous** is a text-based RPG where players are transported into the "Museum of Unnatural History" - a bizarre after-hours dimension where neon-infused taxidermy animals come alive. What seems like a horror scenario quickly becomes something more heartfelt, as you discover these creatures are former programmers, artists, and engineers trapped in animal forms, their memories and skills fragmented into code snippets hidden throughout the museum.

Players must build relationships with these misfit creatures, gather code fragments, and ultimately decide whether to help the animals return to human form, embrace their new existence, or escape alone.

### Base Stats
- **CRAFT** (Dexterity): Manual skills, physical adaptation, stealth
- **HEART** (Empathy): Emotional intelligence, communication, animal bonding

### Derived Stats
| Stat | Formula | Learning Area | Game Function |
|------|---------|---------------|---------------|
| **CREATE** | CRAFT + Animal Affinity | Creative design | Crafting exhibits, repairing displays, creating pathways |
| **EXPLAIN** | HEART + Memory Fragments | Documentation | Communicating with animals, unlocking memories, translating code |
| **CODE** | CRAFT + Memory Fragments | Programming | Rewiring exhibits, hacking security, decoding fragments |
| **EXPLORE** | HEART + Animal Affinity | Research | Discovering new museum areas, tracking hidden items, sensing danger |

### Special Resources
- **Memory Fragments**: Pieces of code containing human memories and skills
- **Animal Affinity**: Connection level with different taxidermy species
- **Neon Essence**: Energy that powers abilities and museum transformations

## ü¶ù CHARACTER CREATION

### Museum Entry Method
| Entry Method | Starting Stats | Special Ability | Starting Friend |
|--------------|----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Night Guard Shift** | CRAFT 3, HEART 2 | "Security Override" (bypass one locked area per night) | Edgar the one-eyed eagle (former security engineer) |
| **School Field Trip** | CRAFT 2, HEART 3 | "Curious Mind" (identify one memory fragment type on sight) | Penelope the patched-up penguin (former teacher) |
| **Urban Explorer** | CRAFT 4, HEART 1 | "Parkour" (reach one high area per night without checks) | Rocky the raccoon (former game designer) |
| **New Curator** | CRAFT 1, HEART 4 | "Cataloging" (automatically map any room entered) | Bartholomew the bow-tied bear (former museum director) |

### Personal Items
Each character starts with one personal item that grants unique abilities:
- **Polaroid Camera**: Captures memories, temporarily solidifying them
- **Mixtape Walkman**: Different tracks calm different animal species
- **Digital Watch**: Keeps track of time before dawn (when everything resets)
- **Repair Kit**: Allows emergency fixes to damaged exhibits

## üèõÔ∏è MUSEUM WINGS

The museum is divided into four wings, each corresponding to a learning area:

### 1. The Workshop (CREATE)
- **Theme**: Taxidermy preparation area with preservation tools, mannequins, and crafting stations
- **Guardian**: Maxwell the mantis (former makerspace founder)
- **Challenges**: Repair damaged exhibits, create new displays, restore fading neon
- **Learning Focus**: Designing systems, creative problem-solving, UI concepts

### 2. The Archives (EXPLAIN)
- **Theme**: Museum library filled with strange field guides, journals, and taxonomies that shift when unobserved
- **Guardian**: Olivia the owl (former technical writer)
- **Challenges**: Translate animal languages, document museum history, organize scattered memories
- **Learning Focus**: Documentation, clear communication, knowledge organization

### 3. The Control Room (CODE)
- **Theme**: Retro-futuristic security center with analog computers, glowing control panels, and surveillance monitors
- **Guardian**: Terry the turtle (former systems administrator)
- **Challenges**: Reprogram exhibit behaviors, hack security systems, decrypt memory fragments
- **Learning Focus**: Programming concepts, logical thinking, debugging

### 4. The Dioramas (EXPLORE)
- **Theme**: Massive habitat recreations that change layouts nightly, filled with hidden passages
- **Guardian**: Fiona the fox (former field researcher)
- **Challenges**: Map changing landscapes, track missing animals, find hidden code caches
- **Learning Focus**: Research methodology, pattern recognition, discovery techniques

## üåô GAMEPLAY LOOP

### Night Cycle
1. **Dusk**: Player enters museum, goals are established
2. **Midnight**: Animals fully awaken, all areas become accessible
3. **Early Morning**: Peak activity, most challenging puzzles
4. **Dawn Approach**: Race against time, animals begin to freeze
5. **Daybreak**: Reset - progress saved in memory fragments and relationships

### Relationship System
- Animals have trust meters that increase through successful interactions
- Higher trust reveals more of their human memories and unique abilities
- Maximum trust allows access to their core memory (major code fragment)

### Memory Fragment Collection
- Snippets of code hidden throughout the museum
- Each unlocks new abilities or reveals story elements
- Combining fragments reconstructs the event that created this reality

## üéÆ SAMPLE SCENARIOS

### The Broken Exhibit
- **Challenge**: A damaged wolf exhibit is leaking neon essence
- **Approach**: Use CREATE to repair the physical damage, CODE to stabilize the neon flow
- **Reward**: Wolf trusts you enough to reveal location of a memory fragment

### The Forgotten Password
- **Challenge**: Archive terminal contains crucial information but is locked
- **Approach**: Use EXPLAIN to interview animals about the former curator, EXPLORE to find password hints
- **Reward**: Access to museum blueprints, revealing secret passages

### The Fading Memory
- **Challenge**: An animal is losing their human memories, becoming more feral
- **Approach**: Use HEART to stabilize them, CODE to backup their memory fragments
- **Reward**: New ability to temporarily transfer memories between exhibits
