## üî± GAME OVERVIEW

**Neon Spartan Isekai: A Cruel Angle's Thesis** is a tongue-in-cheek text-based RPG that blends ancient Spartan aesthetics with modern isekai anime tropes and 1980s neon visual style. Players control a protagonist who has been transported from the modern world into a bizarre hybrid reality where ancient Sparta meets synthwave aesthetics and anime logic.

The game serves as both an entertaining adventure and a scaffolding for learning AI fundamentals and programming concepts, with its four main gameplay areas mapping directly to educational objectives.

## üõ°Ô∏è CORE MECHANICS

### Inherent Stats
- **Arete** (Excellence/Virtue): Represents physical prowess, combat ability, traditional wisdom, and honor-based interactions
- **Hubris** (Pride/Arrogance): Represents magical ability, otherworldly knowledge, technological aptitude, and unconventional solutions

### Derived Stats
Each derived stat corresponds to a learning area in the curriculum:

| Derived Stat | Formula | Learning Area | Game Function |
|--------------|---------|---------------|---------------|
| **Create**   | Hubris + Worldly | Creative problem-solving | Crafting, building, item creation |
| **Explain**  | Arete + Otherworldly | Communication/documentation | Dialogue, persuasion, knowledge checks |
| **Code**     | Hubris + Otherworldly | Programming concepts | Hacking, magic system, special abilities |
| **Explore**  | Arete + Worldly | Research methodology | Navigation, discovery, resource gathering |

### Secondary Derived Stats
- **Worldly**: (Arete + Create) / 2 - Represents understanding of the physical world
- **Otherworldly**: (Hubris + Code) / 2 - Represents understanding of magical/technological systems
- **Metis** (Cunning): (Arete + Hubris) / 2 - Affects strategy options in combat and puzzles
- **Pathos** (Suffering): Base value determined by Origin - Unlocks special abilities and narrative options
- **Kleos** (Glory): Currency earned through victories and achievements - Used for character progression
