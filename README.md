# neon_isekai
pronounced "Neon Blank Isekai"

ok so as long as it's some kind of Isekai you can change the rest.

or just call it "Another World Project" if you don't want to say 'Isekai' idc

you have two parts of yourself, sometimes they're at odds with each other.

they affect different things (worldly and otherworldly) differently depending on what you do.

You can use a LLM to help you make or play any of this (so feel free to try to 'exploit' the rules)
